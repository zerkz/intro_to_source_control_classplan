# Intro to Source Control
This repository guide on how to teach an intro to source control, meant for the high school level, using Github pages.

This is useful if you, as an educator, want to introduce the concept of source control in an exciting way to your students. 

# Goals

* Teach basic source control concepts using `git`, particularly on Github. These concepts include
  * Commits
  * Branches
  * Merge Conflicts
  * Pull Requests
* Only require about 2-3 hours of class time.
* Be interesting, to maintain attentiveness.

# Solutions
To keep it interesting, but accessible, this plan focuses on HTML/JS and usage of Github Pages. This is interesting to most students at the high school level, because most classes tend to focus upon Java, Python, and low level algorithms. This class is meant to entice students via producing a real-world, online, sharable creation.
